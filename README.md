# Stock Portfolio Tracker

This repository contains a simple command-line based Stock Portfolio Tracker developed as part of the Python Programming Internship at CodeAlpha. The tool enables users to simulate portfolio tracking by inputting stock quantities and calculating the total investment value using hardcoded stock prices.

## Project Objective

## Features

- Hardcoded dictionary of popular stock symbols with prices
- User-friendly input to add multiple stock holdings
- Portfolio summary showing quantity, unit price, and total value
- Option to save output to a `.txt` or `.csv` file
- Error handling for invalid symbols and quantities

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Built-in Libraries:
  - `datetime` for timestamped file names
  - `csv` for exporting results
  - `input`/`output` for user interaction

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed.
2. Clone this repository or download the code files.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command:

```bash
python stock_tracker.py
